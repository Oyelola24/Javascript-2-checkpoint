Pseudocode Algorithms Collection
üìå Purpose
The goal of this collection is to:
- Strengthen understanding of fundamental algorithmic logic.
- Provide templates for commonly used routines in problem-solving.
- Help students write structured pseudocode for exams or assignments.
- Serve as a bridge between logic and implementation in languages like Python, Java, or C++.
üß† Algorithms Included
Algorithm Name	Description
CapitalizeWords	Capitalizes the first letter of every word in a sentence.
CountCharacters	Counts and returns the number of characters in a given string.
FactorialCalculator	Computes the factorial of a given positive integer using a loop.
FibonacciGenerator	Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms.
FilterArray	Filters and returns only elements greater than or equal to 10 from an array.
FindMaxAndMin	Finds the maximum and minimum values in an integer array.
PrimeChecker	Checks if a number is a prime using a loop-based approach.
ReverseString	Reverses the characters of a given string.
SumArray	Calculates and returns the sum of elements in an array.
üîß Structure
Each algorithm is written with the following components:
- Algorithm Declaration: Name of the algorithm.
- Global Variables: Declared outside the function.
- Function Block: The core logic encapsulated in a function with a clear return value.
- Main Program Block: Demonstrates how to call the function and display output.
Example structure:
ALGORITHM AlgorithmName

VAR
    input, output : DATATYPE

FUNCTION function_name(parameters...) : RETURN_TYPE
BEGIN
    // Logic here
END FUNCTION

BEGIN
    // Main execution block
END
üß™ How to Use
You can use this pseudocode in the following ways:
- Practice manually tracing algorithms.
- Convert to actual programming languages such as Python, Java, or C/C++.
- Use in exams or assignments where pseudocode is required.
- Enhance logical thinking before jumping into syntax-heavy languages.
üìò Learning Objectives
By studying and practicing these algorithms, you will:
- Understand loop structures (FOR, WHILE).
- Learn conditional logic (IF, ELSE).
- Master function writing and parameter passing.
- Work with arrays and string operations.
- Solve classic algorithmic problems in a structured format.
‚úÖ Example Output
For SumArray, with input [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]:
The total sum is: 150
For PrimeChecker with input 29:
The number is prime.
üìÇ File Format
Currently provided in pseudocode-style text (not tied to any specific language). Can be easily converted to:
- .txt files for sharing
- .md files for GitHub projects
- Code templates in other languages
